"""
You're given strings J representing the types of stones that are jewels, 
and S representing the stones you have.  Each character in S is a type of 
stone you have.  You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.

The letters in J are guaranteed distinct, and all characters in J and S are letters. 
Letters are case sensitive, so "a" is considered a different type of stone from "A".
